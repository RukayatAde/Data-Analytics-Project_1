# Mental Health in the Tech Industry 

   - That's an interesting topic to explore. Mental health is a crucial issue, and it's important to understand how it affects the tech industry globally. There are many factors that   contribute to mental health issues in the tech industry, such as long working hours, high stress levels, and job insecurity.

   - To start the analysis, it has been considered collecting data on the prevalence of mental health issues in the tech industry across different countries.Information on the types of  mental health issues that are most commonly reported, such as anxiety, depression, burnout, and stress has been gathered. This could be done by conducting surveys, collecting data  from existing studies, and analyzing data from mental health organizations.

   -  It would also be useful to investigate the factors that contribute to mental health issues in the tech industry, such as workplace culture, management practices, and work-life  balance. This could involve conducting interviews with tech industry professionals and analyzing company policies and practices.

   -  In addition, it has been exploreed about the impact of mental health issues on the tech industry, such as decreased productivity, increased absenteeism, and higher employee turnover rates. This could be done by collecting data on the financial and operational costs of mental health issues in the tech industry.

   -  Overall, there are many avenues to explore when analyzing the topic of mental health in the tech industry. By conducting a comprehensive analysis, it can be gained an insights into  the scope of the problem, the factors that contribute to it, and potential solutions to improve mental health in the tech industry.
   

## Data analysis 

   -  Initially the raw data has been assessed interms of qualitative and quantitatve information.
   -  Pre processing of the data have been implimented. These include by calculating the percentages of NA in relation to number of participants, considering when, where the survey has 	been taken and also comments provided as well. Hence, based on these pre-assessments, data cleaning such as dropping non-impacting columns, replacing of catagories into specific 	groups based on their meaning and content has been done. Furthermore, since negative ages and unusual ages have been noticed in the survey, age treatment has been considred sticking 	to practical age exposure to tech industry. 
   -  Finally, visualization of each question with their findings and insights have been done.
   -  Final concusion has been provided for limitations and future improvements.

## Research Questions 

That's a very important research area to focus on, as mental health issues in the tech industry are a growing concern. By understanding the provisions at tech workplaces to address mental health issues in employees, we can gain insights into the factors that contribute to mental health issues in the industry, as well as potential solutions to improve mental health support for employees.

By understanding the extent to which these provisions are currently available in tech workplaces and how they are perceived by employees, we can identify areas for improvement and develop strategies to better support employees' mental health in the industry.

Hence, the following questions have been used to make analysis, produce insights and make visualization images

  1. which age group are the most valunerable ?
  2. Have you sought treatment for a mental health condition?
  3. What is your age?
  4. If you have a mental health condition, do you feel that it interferes with your work?
  5. Do you have a family history of mental illness?
  6. Do you work remotely (outside of an office) at least 50% of the time?

  8. Has your employer ever discussed mental health as part of an employee wellness program?
  9. Does your employer provide resources to learn more about mental health issues and how to seek help?


## Methodology 

 - By making your analysis and code available on a Github repository, it makes it easier for others to replicate your analysis and build on your findings.

 - Visualizing the findings through graphs is also a great way to communicate the results and make them more accessible to a wider audience. By comparing the findings globally, it can  be gained  a better understanding of how mental health issues and support differ across different regions and countries.

 - It's also important to document the observations and interpretations of the data to provide context for the findings and to help others understand the implications of the analysis.  This could include discussing the limitations of the analysis, potential confounding variables, and areas for future research.

 -  Overall, by sharing the analysis and findings through a Github repository, it makes us contributing to the larger conversation around mental health in the tech industry and helping  to promote transparency and reproducibility in data analysis. 

## Conclusion 

 - It is useful to conside that the findings  may not be fully representative of the entire population. In this case, the survey respondents may not be a fair representation of the  entire population in the tech industry and workplaces, which could limit the generalizability of the findings.

 - However, this limitation can be mitigated by acknowledging the sample size and characteristics of the survey respondents, as well as the context in which the survey was conducted.  It's important to clearly communicate these limitations in any reporting or communication of the study's findings.

 -  Additionally, it's vital to consider the provisions for mental health support in the tech industry  vary widely across different regions and countries, and that there may be  different  factors that influence mental health issues and support. Therefore, it should not be mislieading and proper care should be taken when generalizing the outcomes of this  study to other palces.

 -  Overall, having considred the limitations, the insights and findings can still be useful in providing a step for further research around mental health in the tech industry.
